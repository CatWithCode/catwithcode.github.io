    <h1>Privacy and Cookies:</h1>    
    <p>This Website is hosted on porkbun.com. This website is only made from static HTML documents that are displayed in your browser. The code of this Website can be viewed as a Code-Repository:</p>
    <p><a href="https://github.com/CatWithCode/catwithcode.github.io">catwithcode.moe.mirror - Repository</a></p>
    <p>Porkbun.com itself as the host can collect stuff. What information they can potentially collect from visitors (if any) can be found in there policys. I don't do anything with cookies. I coded this website myself without anything external in use. Thanks to that I know exactly what my HTML, CSS and JS files can do. Cookies are something they cannot do. What your browser dose on its own, like pre-caching of Links or similar, I don't know and I don't care. Thats your issue.</p>

      <b>More information about the provider for the domain and web hoster:</b>

    <p>If you view the GitHub-Mirror of my website, I can see information every developer on GitHub can see when someone is looking at there GitHub Repositorys. If a Link on this website goes to a external website, then there rules count at this point and I have no control over the code there and what they do with your data! If your browser is configured in a certain way it even can load links into memory without you even clicking on them. If that's the case that's on you. Code and hosted information on the linked pages can change in the future! That is not in my hand! If a link goes to a bad location in the future just send me a message (look at the "CONTACT"-Page for more information) and I remove the link from the website as fast as possible.</p>
    <p>
      I have some issues with my provider currently that makes it hart to show images or videos hosted directly on my website if they are higher quality and/or a larger file size thanks to a weird speed cap and GitHub sync issue's. I'm currently unsure if it's a bug on there side or the plan I'm using has such a limit. I will change this as soon as this is cleared up. But as long as this is the case it will link larger files from GitHub with the “raw” link. This works fast and files smaller then 100MB can be displayed like that.
      <br>
      <br>
      TL;DR: Some pages on my website could link to GitHub 'raw' files directly for some time until the speed cap and sync issue is sorted out.

    <h1>I don't care about you and your data! Leave me alone.</h1>
    <p>About RSS: I add links inside the RSS-Feed entry's to the mentioned blog entry or whatever, the same on Project pages like RE//POSSESSED, and not always do I have a page to directly link to. Many RSS-Readers differentiate Sub-Feeds by the URLs. I don't do that so I needed unique links for every entry. In Cases where the URL is always the same I add a completely useless and unused parameter to the URL like "?item=1". That is normally used on webpage's to add data to URLs but I use Static HTML files for my websites and the parameter is completely unused and I can not and do not anything with it. The added parameter is not even that logical because it is just the entry number for the Feed-Entry. I must do that or Readers will break the Feed by assuming it is all one long continues entry and only load one entry of the feed because of the URLs.</p>
    <p>Now that I'm hosting my website with a real web host, I can potentially see a lot more information than I could on the github pages. I now "own" the hosted website and domain and can do a lot more with it. I don't care about your data and I never will. And what web hosting, domain ownership and DNS management potentially allows me to see, I don't even know. Inform yourself. This is just the way the internet works, bro.</p>
    <p><b><u>Contact Information</u>:</b> If you contact me privately or publicly via any channel, information will be stored. Either publicly via social media or github topics or privately as emails/direct messages. I do not do anything with this information. I can delete them if I want or need to (I do that from time to time anyway for housekeeping). Private messages remain private (unless both parties agree to make them public). I will reserve myself the right to report public and private messages if they break the law an/or threaten/endanger me in any way to the respective authority's.</p>
