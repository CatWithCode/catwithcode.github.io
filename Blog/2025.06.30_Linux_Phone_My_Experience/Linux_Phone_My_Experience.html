    <h1>My experience with Linux on Mobile</h1>
    <p>I tested Ubuntu Touch again. It works great now. Everything is working but I notices something for myself. FOR ME, it works, but is not viable.</p>
    <p>This is my opinion, dose not apply to most people reading this I guess and is only about my use-case. Sadly my use-cases is exactly what is still in the works on most Linux Mobile OS's and will stay that way for a foreseeable future and keeps me back from truly using Linux on Mobile (Missing secure, widely used and OpenSource chat options, Battery-life, navigation and to some extend reliability).</p>
    <p>A mobile phone must do 3 things for me: I must be reachable, I must be able to use navigation and it MUST work WITHOUT ANY exceptions in emergencys.</p>
    <p>Ubuntu Touch works (FOR ME) this far. I am somewhat reachable as long as I check waydroid from time to time. I am able to use GPS with janky passthrough or an app from the OpenStore. With Libertine I can get more apps and work my way through my needs. What is the result. Multiple layers running that cause heavy battery use. With luck, a day. On LineageOS I get around three days.</p>
    <p>The security concept of desktop Linux not being suitable for Mobile Phones is also a topic often broth up. App isolation, to much security in places were it makes sense for a Desktop OS but not for a Mobile one (System Settings change or Sandbox resetingor Login) and to little like missing A-B-slot systems or forced home and system encryption/btrfs rollback on update or setup errors.</p>
    <p>Don't get me wrong I love Linux and love love LOVE these projects like Ubuntu Touch or PostmarkedOS, that's why I try them from time to time again and again, but the result stays the same. The compromises are to big for what I get. For a heavy mobile computer user this could be the dream OS type for there phone, but for me who uses 3 apps and one being a web-browser, it is just power consuming and usability hindering.</p>
    <p>We need competition and more MobileOS's but until Linux on Mobile can run Android apps emulated with little to no power loss and full functionality OR just has the app's I need out of the box (Android and IOS have done everything to make this near impossible. Everything is for Android or IOS. Ubuntu Touch, Linux (PostmarkedOS) or even KaiOS are literally nowhere supported) it will not be viable as a daily driver for me.I hate phones and touchscreens for nearly anything except the 3 thing mentioned at the beginning. I use my phone as a tool. If I want to play, learn or do something I use a Linux PC.</p>
    <p>Battery-life, Minimal software (aka. ZERO bloat and only the app's and functions I need) and OpenSource and Privacy and reliability is all I need for my phone. LineageOS with just the App's I need and heavily locked down settings for ALL app's fits that bill. All requirements meet. The freedom in what I use or install is limited to Android app's and janky termux stuff but it works the best for now.</p>
    <p>That obviously restricts options and usability in the future. Binary blobs and missing source code will limit the availability of update's up to a point and then the phone starts falling behind OS wise. That can only be prevented with drivers and everything in the OS being in the Linux Kernel and OpenSource. That is why I think that these projects must go on and need testing and development even if daily use stays limited for many. They are the one's, that will keep device running far into the future. If manufacturers would just release the source code and schematics so that it can be more development and less reverse engineering would be ideal but we all know how the phone world looks like.</p>
    <p>I will still stay in the space and look how it develops, test and help here and there but using it for real, daily, a long time will most likely not happen, at least for me for the foreseeable future.</p>
