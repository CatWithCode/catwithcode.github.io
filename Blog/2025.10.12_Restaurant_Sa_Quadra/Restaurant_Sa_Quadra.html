    <p>Okay, listen, hear me out, I know I normally do only tech stuff but I was on a little vacation with my husband and we found this restaurant somewhat near our hotel. It was so UNBELIEVABLY good I just MUST write about it to quiet done the gobline in my brain. That way I will at least never fully forget it. They only have a small google maps entry and a facebook page and that is it, no online presents. So if you want to read something different then the usual from me, I will now write for like 4 minutes about how good the food was there and be sad because the restaurant is on an island and unreachable for me from now on.

    <h2>The restaurant itself:</h2>
    <p>Lovely. Very open and hos no doors really. Has the downside that bad weather and mosquitoes have it easy but else it is so cute and unassuming. Especially the signs around the entrances. Sunburned af and hand made. Next to the main entrance is a display that shows a (probably) windows image slide show with way to loud music, just perfect. The musics was, no matter what, covers of every type of music under the sun to soul. Not always perfect and sometimes funny but still a vibe!</p>

    <h2>The food:</h2>
    <p>Normally I'm not much of a meat person, and if then only chicken, but in Spain I not always had a choice. So we tried one of every menu category at the end of our vacation (yes we went there every other day lol) and everything was phenomenal. Pizza crunchy and very tasty without being fatty, the "Ensaimada de crema con helado" is my new favorite desert now period, the "crema catalana casera" was perfect, "Chicken breast with leek sauce" was so different then I expected and so far better then I ever thought it be and everything else my husband and I ate was just to die for.</p>

    <h2>The rest:</h2>
    <p>The personal was very friendly, the prices, for the type of restaurant and region it is in, appropriate and I probably will not eat so much good food in one place again. If you are reading this and are in he area and thinking about going there, I can highly recommend it!</p>

    <p>*I took all the images myself (or my husband made them), I censored every name and person in them. They also are very bad because I normally don't take photos when I do anything, because why would I, so I only had my phone with me.</p>
