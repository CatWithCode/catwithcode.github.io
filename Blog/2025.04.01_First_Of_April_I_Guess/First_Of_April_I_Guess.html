    <h1>First of April, I Guess</h1>
    <p>To be honest IDK. why I did that. A friend challenged me and I thought it would be funny. So... I made my OC a CatGirl... Racon girl? I guess IDK. to be honest xD. This was also a challenge to myself to see how much my ability to create my ideas in 3D models improved and well, I think I am able to do it now for what it is worth. And I like my art style if you can call it that. I can not imagine any images in my head, like at all. That always made it really hard for me to draw or fully imagine if something would look good. At first I did not know what I was doing but now I can use the tools provided to me, and actually create what I want. The latest thing I did yesterday in RE//POSSESSED was to nearly complete one of the BAR areas. And I also wanted to slip a reference to "VA-11 Hall-A" into it. And I think I did what I wanted to do.</p>
    <p>But I am also not stupid. Hands still look... well, bad LOL and textures still can be improved a LOT especially if I want to represent more then just a wall or ground.</p>
    <p>I also use Blockbench in ways it was never intended to be used for and, especially in my game, work completely without bones which makes animations really hard because the low poly connection points must be always be considered/worked around. This could change at some point if I should ever want to switch to different tools for my art/images/website stuff like Blender. But the game models stay boneless.</p>
    <p>More about the model: At first she was not based on anything. I just tried to make a "human" model. And then used it as a base for subsequent models. At the point of creation I called her still a "it" because it was just a model for the logo and I was still unsure what I want to do with the model. By now I femmed her up more, fixed a few things and well she is a Racon? for now :D. To be honest from the beginning of the creation of her model I was always inspired by the anime "Ergo Proxy" and especially the character "Re-L Mayer". And now I brought the inspiration more into the design with a far more similar hair style and cloth coloring (within the limitations of the "Zenith" Color palette by "SweetAvery"). The... cat? part is very loosely based on "BNA: Brand New Animal". I like her a lot. I still don't have a name… mmmhhh. Great “OC” I know xD.</p>
    <br>
    <p>And yes, I will count this as a April fools joke even thought I hate that everyone thinks on that day the same joke is always funny and I definitely did not post this past midnight.</p>
