    <h1>Design made worst</h1>
    <p>I added more effects to the website. I called this entry “Design made worst” because everyone I asked says it makes the design worst. I will probably fix a few things and will maybe also add a few things. This page will updated for it to keep the “final” new design preserved as all the old ones were too (I linked to them in the Sources).</p>
    <p>I originally wanted to use CSS and JS but dynamically making the rain was either very performance intensive (Not only my code. Same issue with examples of others) or broke the pages in many funny ways. I then just decided to use CSS animations and a PNG. It works. It's a little primitive and still a (very very little) more performance intensive then it could be but good enough for now. There is still a reset "Bug" where the background stutters. It behaves different from all browsers and devices I tested. Sooo... long delay xD. I linked a inspiration too.</p>
