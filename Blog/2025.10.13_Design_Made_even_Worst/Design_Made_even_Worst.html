    <h1>Design Made even more Worst</h1>
    <p>I added Oneko like many other tech blog and project pages to my website :D. I did adjust OnekoJS a good amount to fit my workflow and be more readable for me. After that I adjusted A LOT of stuff on how the dynamic elements on my website work so they don't break in edge cases like google translate pages or in the Internet Archive. I little time ago I also adjusted the DNS redirect for the GitHub pages version for search engines so it also not cause issues in Mirrors or Archives but added detection and notice if it is viewed that way. The redirect is now domain specific.</p>
    <p>I like aSync stuff but the issue is that it breaks in many scenarios and I don't want that anymore. But making all dynamic HTML elements into strings in JS is way to error prone when done by hand... well now I have a script that dose that automatically. I adjust my elements and updated the static copy's in JS with one click (or even remove them). Is this bad practices and extremely jank? YES. Dose it work better then aSync and thanks to be loaded already dose not cause load freezes? YES. There is a reason why these scripts are rights reserved, they are very specific and not really good to work with if not self written no to long ago... . And sadly this is also a very JS heavy adjustment (like the transparency, the background, the rain, Cat or the new Oneko) so making is static for Archiving the new Design is not really possible without making a lot of changes I don't want to make. Here the Internet Archive and git history to some extend are the replacement.</p>
    <p>So am I done with the design changes already? No. I will fix a few CSS things that broke thanks to the static HTML in JS and then when I find time and motivation, re-color Oneko to look like Coffee and better fit into the color pallet of my page (right now Oneko looks a little out of place).</p>
    <p>And yes, I know, the "Design even worst"-Title joke was not funny the first time ether.</p>
