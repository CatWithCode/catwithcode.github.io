    <h1>New add-on to the website design</h1>
    <p>After a long hard week, both with work and game-dev, I decided I want to do something stupid. Something really really stupid.</p>
    <p>You surely know all these stupid popups with a fake chat to the support right? Well I thought I will throw this concept under the bus then from the rooftop and then drive over it three and a half times with my bicycle. And now we have two new great additions to my website.</p>
    <p>For one, my "OC" finally has a name. I call her "Cat". Not like the animal, more like the name "Cathrin" but shortened. I know my imagination is an infinite pool of great ideas. First I call the main character of RE//POSSESSED "C" and now the Website OC "Cat" like in CatWithCode... .</p>
    <p>Regardless, if you put your mouse near the spinning T-Posing (yes I know, really funny) Cat icon you will get "her" opinion to topics. We all know that this will be only a textbox and an opportunity for me to sh*tpost but I think it is really funny and kinda cool the website has it's own "eco-system" going on LOL.</p>
    <p>And yes, to code it in a way so it can be statically dynamically loaded was annoying. Async was not possible (at least for now, until I find a way to get class based CSS styling to work with async innerHTML. Header and footer already work async but they don't get class based CSS applied to them. They just replace a warning text).</p>
    <br>
    <p>I am not sure if I will make this "design update" also half static like the others. Because I would need to separate the Function java script file for it and that could break this entry in really bad ways or would need updating from time to time. The design itself did not really change... just a few optimizations and a global change in the scripting for "Cat".</p>
